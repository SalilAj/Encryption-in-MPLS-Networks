- page iv: don't mention congestion control, it's not done by MPLS, but is
in fact made more difficult by (some) MPLS deployments. I think you 
mean "traffic engineering."

- page v: The IETF doesn't "do" work - s/by/in/ and don't say "plague" as
that's too subjective unless you can back it up via reference (generally
avoid such unnecessary editorialising)

- page v: "this thesis aims to provide..." is wrong - the thesis has no
aims (humans do) and doesn't "provide" the PoC - the thesis *describes*
the PoC. 

COMMMIT

- page vi: what's an "internal" protocol?

- page vii: s/was mainly relied on/mainly relied on/

- page vii: there's physical isolation, IPsec and also MACsec, so 3 not
2 options

- page vii: refer to RFC 7435 for definition of OS, maybe include some quotes from
that RFC. The definition of OS can be contentious, so you want to be able
to point to one and not assume the reader agrees with what you think it
means:-)

- page vii: "can contribute greatly" is overstated - we don't have the
evidence for that, so don't overclaim!

- page vii; "this paper" is wrong, this is a thesis, and it doesn't
"implement," it describes the implementation

COMMIT

- page viii: "we will setup" is the wrong tense - you should be saying
what has been done, not what will be done (except for the future 
work section)

- page viii: "give us a good idea" is overstated

- page 1: "IP routing is a destination based routing protocol" is 
not true.  IP routing is not *a* protocol at all.
Please make sure you get the initial bits of text in each section
very correct - readers are more likely to get the wrong or a bad
idea if there're errors in places like that.

- page 1: you keep saying "switch" - you may want to add a footnote
saying that when yoy say switch, you mean switch or router or 
something like that to make clear you know they differ.

- page 6: are the bottom of stack bit values correct? I thought
the value was 1 for the label just before the payload and 
furthest from the ethernet header?

- page 6: TTL issues are more likely due to errors and not
attacks

- page 6: "grave concern" is overstated, don't do that

- page 7: It's "IPsec" not "IPSEC" (really:-)

- page 7: I don't believe 30% of web sites use IPsec.
Please check that fact again.

COMMIT

- page 7: LDP - you didn't introduce that, be good to add a bit
of text saying what it is/does

- p7, you didn't say what GMPLS is - all acronyms need to be
defined on 1st use (same for PE)

- p9, some broken references there

- p11, "sniffing" isn't a great term and you should reference
things like upstream [1] (not the wikipedia page but some
of its references) as that's the real threat we're trying to
counter here. To be clear - the threat is that (particularly
subsea) fibre operators collude with govs to copy bits off
of MPLS routers.

   [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstream_collection

- p17, 1.3.1 didn't say which threats are (hoped to be)
mitigated by this work, that needs to be somewhere to tie
together the problem and solution

COMMIT

- p19, things here need references, e.g. tls is rfc8446 now,
etc.

- p21, I'm still not sure about this PW encryption stuff - are you
*sure* they're really encrypting? There are VPNs that are really
PWs but they don't encrypt in any useful way iiuc. Be sure you
get this one right! (And I'd be interested in the explanation.)

- p24, you need to say GCM is an AEAD mode and refer to RFC5116.

- p27, the seq num in the CW is not the nonce, but is the
low-order 16 bits of the nonce.

- p35, somewhere (not sure if before here or after) you need
to explain your implementation

- p36, usually good to visibly distinguish commands a person might
type, but if you're out of time don't bother

- p40, linux kernel crypto api needs a reference or footnote

- p41, skb needs a reference/footnote

COMMIT

- p50 - is that a 50ms RTT for plan MPLS and a 125 ms RTT for
MPLS OS? That's too long IMO, should be 1000x quicker on a
local connection. I think you should explain why, or say that you're
not curently sure. And why the bipolar y-values for mpls-oe?

- p51, sections 4.2 and 4.3 - what's the deal here? 

- yeah chapter 4 is light. Any more useful stuff you can add
there is worthwhile.

- p53 - yep, that chapter is light-weight be no har to take
a peek later see if we can increase "interest" desl likely
with Trump?

DONE - please re-read the notes above
