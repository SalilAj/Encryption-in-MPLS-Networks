- page iv: don't mention congestion control, it's not done by MPLS, but is
in fact made more difficult by (some) MPLS deployments. I think you 
mean "traffic engineering."

- page v: The IETF doesn't "do" work - s/by/in/ and don't say "plague" as
that's too subjective unless you can back it up via reference (generally
avoid such unnecessary editorialising)

- page v: "this thesis aims to provide..." is wrong - the thesis has no
aims (humans do) and doesn't "provide" the PoC - the thesis *describes*
the PoC.
