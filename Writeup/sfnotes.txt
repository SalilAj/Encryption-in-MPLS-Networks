- page iv: don't mention congestion control, it's not done by MPLS, but is
in fact made more difficult by (some) MPLS deployments. I think you 
mean "traffic engineering."

- page v: The IETF doesn't "do" work - s/by/in/ and don't say "plague" as
that's too subjective unless you can back it up via reference (generally
avoid such unnecessary editorialising)

- page v: "this thesis aims to provide..." is wrong - the thesis has no
aims (humans do) and doesn't "provide" the PoC - the thesis *describes*
the PoC.

- page vi: what's an "internal" protocol?

- page vii: s/was mainly relied on/mainly relied on/

- page vii: there's physical isolation, IPsec and also MACsec, so 3 not
2 options

- page vii: refer to RFC 7435 for definition of OS, maybe include some quotes from
that RFC. The definition of OS can be contentious, so you want to be able
to point to one and not assume the reader agrees with what you think it
means:-)

- page vii: "can contribute greatly" is overstated - we don't have the
evidence for that, so don't overclaim!

- page vii; "this paper" is wrong, this is a thesis, and it doesn't
"implement," it describes the implementation

COMMIT

- page viii: "we will setup" is the wrong tense - you should be saying
what has been done, not what will be done (except for the future 
work section)

- page viii: "give us a good idea" is overstated

- page 1: "IP routing is a destination based routing protocol" is 
not true.  IP routing is not *a* protocol at all.
Please make sure you get the initial bits of text in each section
very correct - readers are more likely to get the wrong or a bad
idea if there're errors in places like that.

- page 1: you keep saying "switch" - you may want to add a footnote
saying that when yoy say switch, you mean switch or router or 
something like that to make clear you know they differ.

- page 6: are the bottom of stack bit values correct? I thought
the value was 1 for the label just before the payload and 
furthest from the ethernet header?

- page 6: TTL issues are more likely due to errors and not
attacks

- page 6: "grave concern" is overstated, don't do that

- page 7: It's "IPsec" not "IPSEC" (really:-)

- page 7: I don't believe 30% of web sites use IPsec.
Please check that fact again.
