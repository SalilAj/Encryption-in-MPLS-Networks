- page iv: don't mention congestion control, it's not done by MPLS, but is
in fact made more difficult by (some) MPLS deployments. I think you 
mean "traffic engineering."

- page v: The IETF doesn't "do" work - s/by/in/ and don't say "plague" as
that's too subjective unless you can back it up via reference (generally
avoid such unnecessary editorialising)

- page v: "this thesis aims to provide..." is wrong - the thesis has no
aims (humans do) and doesn't "provide" the PoC - the thesis *describes*
the PoC.

- page vi: what's an "internal" protocol?

- page vii: s/was mainly relied on/mainly relied on/

- page vii: there's physical isolation, IPsec and also MACsec, so 3 not
2 options

- page vii: refer to RFC 7435 for definition of OS, maybe include some quotes from
that RFC. The definition of OS can be contentious, so you want to be able
to point to one and not assume the reader agrees with what you think it
means:-)

- page vii: "can contribute greatly" is overstated - we don't have the
evidence for that, so don't overclaim!

- page vii; "this paper" is wrong, this is a thesis, and it doesn't
"implement," it describes the implementation
